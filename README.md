# AERO

AERO tracks versioned data sources, records their provenance, and orchestrates
[Globus Flows](https://www.globus.org/globus-flows-service) over them: when a source changes, the
analyses derived from it rerun automatically, and every output is recorded as a new version linked
back to the inputs it came from.

This repository is the **server** — a FastAPI + SQLModel service backed by Postgres. It stores
metadata and submits flow runs; **it never handles data bytes itself**. The functions that pull,
transform and upload files run on a [Globus Compute](https://www.globus.org/compute) endpoint and
live in the companion client repo, [aero-client](https://github.com/NSF-RESUME/DSaaS-client), which
also provides the `aero` command-line tool that users register sources and flows with.

## How it works

A **source** is a `Data` record with a series of `DataVersion`s. Something triggers a flow — a
timer, or a webhook saying an object changed — and from there:

```
trigger ─▶ AERO submits a run of a Globus flow
        ─▶ the flow calls three Globus Compute functions on the endpoint:
             pull the source ─▶ run the user's function ─▶ commit the result
        ─▶ the commit function POSTs provenance back to AERO
        ─▶ AERO records a new version and reruns whatever depends on it
```

That last step is what makes it a pipeline rather than a job runner: recording a version is also
what triggers the next round of flows.

A flow's **policy** decides what starts it — a timer, a change notification, or a new version of
any/all of its inputs.

### Sources that change on their own

For object storage (S3, MinIO), a change notification drives ingestion instead of a timer. Post to
`/data/notify` with the object's identity and AERO resolves it to a source and takes it from there.
Two variations are supported:

- **Types** group several objects under one source, so a change to any of them drives the same
  analysis, and the run is told which object triggered it. Objects can be listed individually or
  matched by a glob pattern — `'test-bucket/**/*.csv'` picks up every CSV at any depth, including
  ones created after the type was registered. `*` stays within a path segment, `**` crosses them.
  Quote the pattern so your shell doesn't expand it.
- **No-copy sources** record a new version from the notification's metadata without moving any
  bytes — nothing is pulled and nothing is staged, and the analysis reads the object directly from
  its URL.

See [docs/typed-notify-sources-plan.md](docs/typed-notify-sources-plan.md) and
[docs/minio-ingestion-howto.md](docs/minio-ingestion-howto.md).

## Running it

Everything runs under Docker Compose: the app (`web`), Postgres (`database`), Adminer, and an nginx
front door.

**1. Create an environment file.** Compose reads it via `SETUP_ENV_SH`, and it is *not* in the
repository — you have to supply it. `scripts/test_env.sh` shows the database variables in the right
shape (note it sets `DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1`, which is wrong inside Compose, where it must be the
service name `database`). See [Configuration](#configuration) for what has to be in it.

**2. Build and create the volume:**

```bash
export SETUP_ENV_SH=/path/to/your_env.sh
source scripts/prepare_start.sh      # builds images, creates the postgres volume, checks the DB
```

**3. Start:**

```bash
docker compose up web database adminer nginx
```

Adminer is on `${ADMINER_PORT:-8080}` and is the practical way to inspect or patch the database.

Running several independent deployments behind one hostname is documented in
[docs/running-multiple-instances.md](docs/running-multiple-instances.md).

### Schema management

**There is no migration tooling.** `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()` runs at startup and is the only
mechanism. It creates tables that don't exist yet and never alters ones that do, so:

- a new **table** appears on the next restart;
- a new **column on an existing table** must be added by hand (Adminer, or `psql`). On startup the
  app checks for the columns it needs and logs the exact `ALTER TABLE` statements if any are
  missing.

The `aero/migrations/` directory is a non-functional remnant of an earlier Flask-Migrate setup —
nothing runs it.

## Configuration

All configuration is environment variables, read in `aero/config.py`.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_HOST` / `_USER` / `_PASSWORD` / `_PORT` / `_NAME` | Postgres connection. Inside Compose the host is `database`. |
| `PORTAL_CLIENT_ID` / `PORTAL_CLIENT_SECRET` | Globus confidential client AERO acts as. Required — the app builds a Globus client at import. |
| `GLOBUS_WORKER_UUID` | Globus Compute endpoint that runs the flow functions. |
| `GCS_*` | Guest collection AERO stages data into. |
| `SEARCH_INDEX` | Globus Search index for published metadata. Created on first start if unset. |
| `AERO_SEARCH_ENABLED` | `false` to run without Globus Search. Indexing needs an index plus the ingest role on it; nothing but `GET /data/search` reads it. |
| `AERO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Shared secret for the notify webhooks (`X-Aero-Token`). **If unset the webhook routes are unauthenticated.** |
| `AERO_REQUIRE_AUTH` | `true` to require a Globus bearer token on the regular API. Off by default. |
| `AERO_AUTH_SCOPE` | Overrides the derived `action_all` scope. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Application log level; `DEBUG` traces request handling. |
| `PROJECT_NAME`, `SETUP_ENV_SH`, `ROOT_PATH_ARG`, `PG_VOLUME`, `DB_PORT`, `ADMINER_PORT` | Compose-level, for running multiple instances. |

## API

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /data/`, `/data/{id}`, `/data/{id}/versions`, `/data/{id}/latest` | Sources and their version history |
| `GET /data/search` | Globus Search query |
| `GET /data/types`, `/data/types/{name}`, `POST /data/types/{name}/urls` | Notification types and the URLs grouped under them |
| `GET /data/{id}/flows`, `DELETE /data/{id}/flows` | What produces and consumes a source; delete those flows (and their provenance) so they can be re-registered |
| `POST /data/source` | Create a source with no flow attached |
| `POST /data/{id}/notify`, `POST /data/notify` | Change webhooks (shared-secret auth, not Globus) |
| `GET /flow/`, `/flow/{id}`, `POST /flow/register` | Register and inspect flows |
| `GET /prov/`, `POST /prov/new` | Provenance; `/prov/new` is how running flows report back |

Interactive docs are at `/docs` on a running instance.

## Development

```bash
pytest tests/                # needs PORTAL_CLIENT_* and DATABASE_* set; tests run on SQLite
tox                          # as CI runs it, with coverage
pre-commit run --all-files   # ruff, ruff-format, codespell
```
